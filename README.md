Installation
------------

The extension has been submitted to the Chrome web store and is awaiting review, which apparently might take a while even though it's just a small silly extension. I suppose they're worried about something that changes text content. If you don't want to wait, you can install it directly.

In Chrome, choose More tools > Extensions. Drag emoji_to_hieroglyphs.crx into the page that appears.

If that doesn't work because of something something security, you can download the Source directory, and load it by clicking the Load Unpackaged Extension button in the Extensions screen.
